# Ruby

## 1. Ruby Tutorial

This tutorial from freeCodeCamp covers most of basics of ruby.

- It is important you code along with the video series. There will be questions asked from this video in the reviews.
- If you already know ruby at least skim through the video.
- Though it says 4 hours in the title, I expect you to take around 2 days to finish it thoroughly.

## 2. Ruby Libs management with gems and bundler

This is good talk about packaging with `Ruby Gems` and `bundler`.

- This talk is very high level. As a side-effect I want you to learn how to digest hard tech talks.
- I will ask questions on this video in class.
- This talk just covers the philosophy of gem/bundler. To learn how to use gem use this [resource](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/).
- And the [bundler tutorial](https://bundler.io/v2.2/#getting-started).

## 4. Drills - Ruby Koans

## 5. Best Practices

### Readability - RuboCop

Install `rubocop` - [Website](https://rubocop.org/). Makes sure you use it in each project.

### Starting a Project

* Always have a .gitignore file and a README.md when starting a project.
* Use relevant .gitignore templates from [https://github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
* README.md file should have a brief project description and how to run, install and/or deploy the project.

## 6. IPL Analysis

### Aim

To convert raw open data (run by run records in this case) into charts that tell some kind of story.

### raw data

The data for this exercise is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl/version/5)

### Instructions

1. Download all the data needed. Consult your mentor if you have any problems accessing the raw data.
1. Initialize `rbenv` for this project. Hint: create `.ruby-version` file.
1. Enable ruby linting via `RuboCop` for this project.
1. All projects should have README.md with instructions on how to run this project.
1. All projects should have .gitignore file to ignore temporary and cached files.

### What your program should do

From the CSV and other source files specified above, write ruby code to ...
1. Read in the data.
2. Write logic to slice / dice / accumulate / transform the data.
3. Using [gruff](https://github.com/topfunky/gruff) plot the plots specified in the problems section.


### Problems


In this data assignment you will transform raw data of IPL to calculate the following stats:
1. Number of matches played per year for all the years in IPL.
2. Number of matches won per team per year in IPL.
3. Extra runs conceded per team in the year 2016
4. Top 10 economical bowlers in the year 2015
5. Find the number of times each team won the toss and also won the match
6. Find a player who has won the highest number of *Player of the Match* awards for each season
7. Find the strike rate of a batsman for each season
8. Find the highest number of times one player has been dismissed by another player
9. Find the bowler with the best economy in super overs

## 7. Developer Testing with RSpec

### Learn RSpec

Your job is to learn the basics of testing Ruby code with RSpec. We have given you below a basic introductory videos on RSpec. Use that as the base material and find other resource on the internet to clarify concepts given in the videos.

## 8. Data Project with Unit Testing

### Aim
To write RSpec code to test your IPL project.

### Step 1
Create a sub set data. ie. choose 3 matches across 3 seasons and only retain that data set.

### Step 2
Refactor your code in such a way it can be tested.

Note: functions/methods are the easiest to test, so try to put as much of code into function.

Note: Testing plot (and images in general) are very hard to test. So do not attempt to test the plots. Instead focus on testing the data structure that produces the plot.

### Step 3
Write RSpec tests for the IPL application.

## Submission

1. Make sure of the following things ...
   - well written README
   - RuboCop config
   - .gitignore
   - Make sure you git ignore csv files
   - Gemfile, Gemfile.lock
2. Submit the Gitlab url of repository.


### 9. Self Review

Write a technical paper on the following concepts.

1. Array methods
2. String methods
3. Objects and Object Oriented Programming
4. Metaprogramming - Monkey Patching/Any other concepts
