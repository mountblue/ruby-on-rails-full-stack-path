## Self Review

Write a technical paper on each topic listed below.

All technical papers should be:
1. in markdown format
2. hosted in a single folder on Gitlab.
3. Use your own words and your own examples.
4. This is for your own revision. Do not copy paste from internet or each other.
5. Less words is appreciated. Make sure it is to the point.
6. Focus more on code samples and codeblocks.

Share link of the folder in your private Discord channel when you start. Also just drop a message when each technical paper is completed.
