# SQL

## 1. Install and get familiar with PostgreSQL

Follow the instructions given in this article
[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart)

## 2. Practice SQL

### 2a. SQLBolt

Complete [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) 3 times.

### 2b. PG Exercises

Complete [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/) 3 times. (Recursive Queries are optional)

## 3. Data Project - SQL Version

Solve the IPL data problem, but this time with SQL, using PostgreSQL database.

#### 1. Create DB, permissions etc.
Write a SQL script that creates a new user, and database. Make the user the owner of the db.

#### 2. Clean up script
Write another SQL script that cleans up the user, and database created in the previous step.

#### 3. Load CSV
Write a SQL script that loads CSV data into a table.

#### 4. Solve the IPL problems
In a SQL file write queries that will solve the problems of the IPL data set, but this time with SQL. You can copy paste the queries in a .sql file and submit.

**Note:** the result in this case is not a graph but SQL Result Set.

### Submission
As with previous projects ...

1. Create a repository - `data-project-database`.
2. All the code for this assignment should be in that repo.
3. Supporting files like .gitignore, README.md should also be included.
4. The README should have all the info for your mentor to run the scripts.
