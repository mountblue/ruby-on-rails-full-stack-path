## What is version control?

Version control is a management system that allows you to record and track changes in your source code and files so that you can recall certain versions later. It’s like a Google Doc for programming, where you can collaborate with multiple people working on the same code and see the source code’s history.

Ultimately, using a version control system allows teams to streamline their development process, which improves their overall efficiency.

### Why is it useful?
**Tracking:** Say you are working on a web application, and one day, you find that your code changes have broken parts of the website. Instead of going through the trouble of finding the bug, you can revert your changes and see what lines of code are causing the problem.

**Teamwork:** Without a version control system, it’s challenging to work on the same source code at once. By using something like Git, you can more easily merge changes, which makes it significantly easier to collaborate on projects.

**Branches:** Say you are working on the footer and header of your website without using a version control system. You’ve finished the header, but not the footer, which means that the project isn’t ready to be public. With a version control system, you can create branches for different aspects of the project you are working on and merge them into​ the main source code when you are done.


### Why should I learn version control?
Due to how useful version control is, it’s almost always a requirement for any developer or engineering job. As you become more accustomed to using a version control system, you will realize how powerful and easy it is to use.

Popular version control systems:

- Github
- GitLab
- Beanstalk
- PerForce

## What is git?

Git is a free, open-source distributed version control system. It keeps track of projects and files as they change over time with the help of different contributors.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file, or set of files, over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Git helps keep track of changes made to a code. If at any point during coding you hit a fatal error and don’t know what’s causing it, Git allows you to revert back to a stable state. It also helps you see what changes have been made to the code over time.

### Repository
A repository (commonly referred to as repo) is a collection of source code. A repository has commits to the project or a set of references to the commits (i.e., heads).

### Commits
A commit logs a change or series of changes that you have made to a file in the repository. A commit has a unique SHA1 hash which is used to keep track of files changed in the past. A series of commits comprises the Git history.

### Branches
A branch is essentially a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the branch where all the changes eventually get merged into - is called the master. This is the official working version of your project and the one that you will see when you visit the project repository at github.com/yourname/projectname.

### Working directory, staging area, and local repo
Every local repository has three different virtual zones. These are:

- Working directory
- Staging area
- Commit area

The working directory is where new files are created, old files are deleted, or where changes are made to already existing files.

Once changes are made, they are added to the staging area. The staging area is also sometimes called the index.

Once the changes are complete​, the staging area will contain one or more files that need to be committed. Creating a commit will cause Git to take the new code from the staging area and make the commit to the main repository​. This commit is then moved to the commit area.


## Create a Gitlab and Github Account

### Gitlab

We will use Gitlab internally for our work. Create a Gitlab account using your **official** email address.

### Github

GitHub is a website where millions of developers gather every day to collaborate on open-source software. It’s also the place that hosts billions of lines of code, and also a place where users of software go to report issues they might have.

In short, it’s a platform for software developers, and it’s built around Git.

As a developer, you can’t avoid using GitHub daily, either to host your code or to make use of other people’s code. This post explains you some key concepts of GitHub, and how to use some of its features that improve your workflow, and how to integrate other applications into your process.

#### If you do not have a Github account, create one using your personal email address.

## How to install git?

### Check If Git is Installed
First, you will want to check to see if you have Git command line tools installed on your computer. If you have been making repositories of your own code, then you likely have Git installed on your local machine. Some operating systems also come with Git installed, so it is worth checking before you install.

You can check whether Git is installed and what version you are using by opening up a terminal window in Linux or Mac, or a command prompt window in Windows, and typing the following command:

```
git --version
```
However, if Git is not installed, you will receive an error similar to the following:

```
-bash: git: command not found

'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```
In this case, you should install Git into your machine. Let’s go through installation for several of the major operating systems.

### Installing Git on Linux
By far the easiest way of getting Git installed and ready to use is by using your version of Linux’s default repositories. Let’s go through how to install Git on your local Linux machine using this method.

Installing Git on Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10
You can use the apt package management tools to update your local package index. Afterwards, you can download and install the program:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

## Setting up Git

Now that you have Git installed, you need to do a few things so that the commit messages that will be generated for you will contain your correct information.

The easiest way of doing this is through the git config command. Specifically, we need to provide our name and email address because Git embeds this information into each commit we do. We can go ahead and add this information by typing:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```
We can see all of the configuration items that have been set by typing:

```
git config --list
```
#### git configuration file
```
user.name=Your Name
user.email=youremail@domain.com
```
As you can see, this has a slightly different format. The information is stored in your Git configuration file, which you can optionally edit by hand with a text editor, like nano for example:
```
nano ~/.gitconfig
```
#### ~/.gitconfig contents
```
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = youremail@domain.com
```
Once you’re done editing your file, you can exit nano by typing the `Ctrl` and `x` keys, and when prompted to save the file press `y`.

There are many other options that you can set, but these are the two essential ones needed to prevent warnings in the future.

## Git Standard Practices

### 1. Using .gitignore

[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/)

### 2. Good Commit Messages

[Git Commit Messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

### 3.Making Effective Commits on Git

#### Small Commits

Make small commits. Let's say you got a task. Instead of doing a 1 commit with 100 lines of code, make sure you break down your task into micro-tasks and then commit for each microtask. This creates your work history and at the same time makes it easier for you to go back to a point where you wrote code that works.

For example, you wrote a function that is working. But you wanted to improve it further. So while improving you realized what you wrote, in the beginning, is actually better. Now in this case, if you don't have a commit history, you won't get the code you wrote in the beginning.

#### Commit Often

Keep committing after every micro-task, don't commit at the end of the day. You will lose a lot of work history. If you use Pomodoro, then make a habit of committing after every Pomodoro.

#### Commit Working Code

Make sure you always commit working code. Never commit something that breaks the codebase. What I mean by this is for example you wrote a function/method for your task that is not being used elsewhere you can commit it. Because it won't break the working application. Alternatively, let's say you are using a method
of a service file in controller, committed controller code, and didn't commit service file code. In this case when the controller action is used the application throws an error, which means code breaks.

Committing working code doesn't mean you have to commit a working feature. It just means whatever you are committing isn't breaking anything.

#### Diff your code

Before committing anything use your ide's diff tool or the integrated Git Version Control. Both VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA has their own diff tools. Make sure you don't commit debug logs, comments, or anything you wrote for your own convenience or testing changes.

#### Always Test your code

You already know you need to commit working code. But how do you make sure about that? For this, once you make changes test your changes thoroughly. Apart from testing your own changes, make sure changes you made to code didn't break some other feature. The best way to do is to trace the usage of your changes in other places using simple find feature of your ide, and then test that feature changes as well.

#### Avoid Committing passwords & secrets

One common mistake beginner developers do is committing API Keys, secrets, and passwords in the repository. Never commit them, this will create a security breach and some hackers misuse them to exploit your server resources. Never ever commit passwords, API keys, Secrets, or Bcrypt salts in the codebase.

### 4. Undoing Changes

#### What If You

- committed the wrong message?
- skipped file in the last commit?
- accidentally committed on master?
- accidentally committed to the wrong branch?
- want to undo the last 5 commits?
- want to undo changes to a file?
